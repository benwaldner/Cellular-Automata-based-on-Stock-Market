# The-Research-of-Herd-Behavior-in-Stock-Market-Based-on-the-Cellular-Automata
Herd Behavior shows that a large number of investors utilize the identical trading strategies or have the same preference for specific assets in a certain period of time, which can well explain the "bounded rationality" in the real world. Through the establishment of a cellular automata model with 90 imitative rules based on three categories of investors and three kinds of market messages, the cellular automata is applied for a simulation experiment on Herd Behavior in the real stock market, and proves that different types of investor behavior and different market messages will affect the behavior of investors. Based on the comparison of stock price, returns time series and investor behavior chart per round, we find that Herd Behavior will begin to highlight in the period of stock price acute fluctuations. Finally, a further statistical test is conducted on the variables such as the stock price and return rates generated by the simulation experiment.
